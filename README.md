The unit tests should serve as a guidance for the enhancements applied to the original code. Attempts have been made to keep the indentation the same as the code original state.

In regards to "_any extra work you would consider important to do before this project was turned into a production application_"
I'd suggest code review with at least 3 more developers and more tests to be done related to thread-safe, deadlocks and cuncurrency.
